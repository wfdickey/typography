      <h2 class="italic">Notes on the acceleration of meaning in a connected world</h2>

  <p>A moment is an exact point in time, an opportunity that can be identified, understood, and served.</p>

  <p>If you have a great meal, there’s a moment of revelation when you taste the first bite. A cold beverage on a hot summer day delivers a moment of refreshment. The perfect outfit delivers a moment of confidence.</p>

  <p>Beyond the philosophical, it’s clear that physiology plays an important role in shaping the importance of moments. The human mind doesn’t retain full events. It records moments, and then, retroactively weaves them into a cohesive whole, greater than the sum of the parts.</p>

  <p>In other words, we are hardwired to see the world through the lens of the moment.</p>

  <h2>Branding the moment</h2>
  <p>Brands (particularly great brands) spend time defining, understanding, and maximizing the moments that matter to them. Nike knows every inch of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJ7G-vY4vA" rel="nofollow">the “Just Do It” moment</a>, and they try to create products and brand experiences that speak to it.</p>

  <aside class="pull-quote right span_2_of_5">

    &ldquo;To inspire moments of optimism and happiness.&rdquo; 
   </aside>

  <p>Through moments, brands are able to understand the exact point in time when they can make a difference, becoming differentiated, loved and indispensable. In other words, great brands know that moments matter, and their ability to leverage those moment is critical to their success.</p>

  <p class="italic">And, moments are on the move.</p>

  <h2>A seismic shift</h2>
  <p>We are on the verge of a seismic shift in the way moments are understood and elevated. The shift will be informed by three basic forces: connectivity, data, and context.</p>

  <figure class="body-img">

  <h3>Connectivity</h3> 
  <p>We live in a connected world. According to Internet World Stats, more than 2.4 billion people (approximately 34% of the global population) use the Internet. While many of them have low-bandwidth, it will not last. Since 2000, there has been a 566% increase in the number of people using the Internet. Everyday, we move one step closer to a completely connected world.</p>

  <h3>Data</h3> 
  <p>Our ability to capture, interpret, and react to large amounts of data is increasing. There are 2.7 zettabytes (that’s 21 zeroes) of data in the digital universe today. By 2020, we’ll generate 35 zettabytes annually. (For context, in April 2011, the U.S. Library of Congress had collected 235 Terabytes.) According to IDC, by 2020, business transactions on the Internet will reach 450 billion per day. The treasure trove of data is getting deeper and richer, and new technologies are enhancing our ability to organize and understand the data.</p>

  <h3>Context</h3 >
  <p>The magic ingredient is context. Data and connectivity are nothing without context. Context is a combination of your situation (location, time of day, temperature, etc.), social graph, and data collected through your past transactions. An example of content without context is direct mail, which is awful. The information driving context is about to change dramatically. Technologies, like the iBeacon, will deliver micro-local information that can be leveraged in the moment.

  <p>An example of content with context is a message about the health benefits of kale, delivered while you are standing in the produce section of a grocery store on a Sunday evening. (Oh, and by the way, they know you like leafy greens because you talk about eating salad on Twitter.)</p>

  <h2>Changing the moment</h2>
  <p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard this argument before. It feels like big data lecture from 2011. Yet, if you interpret this information through the lens of the moment, you&rsquo;ll reach some interesting conclusions.</p>

  <aside class="pull-quote center">
    Connectivity + Data + Context = Moments of Meaning

  <h3>More moments</h3>
  <p>First (and perhaps foremost), the number of acknowledged moments will increase. We can&rsquo;t create time, but with the former forces in place, we can recognize what moments in time matter and create the circumstances for more meaningful moments to unfold.</p>

  <h3>More meaning</h3>
  <p>Context creates meaning. Personally, I welcome information that is tailored to me and my circumstances. If you can recommend a good movie to me, while I stand in front of a Theater, taking my past viewing habits into account, I&rsquo;ll thank you. Better yet, if you adjust the recommendation because my girlfriend is standing next to me, I&rsquo;ll really thank you. (She does not like science fiction movies.</p>

  <h3>More magic</h3>
  <p>I am sure that you know the Arthur C. Clarke quote.</p>

  <aside class="pull-quote center">
    Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
  </aside>

  <p>Although it might seem like magic at first, this trend will uncover more opportunity than it obscures, connecting moments together in new and unique ways. It will open partnership and affiliate opportunities that cross industry boundaries, linking disparate experiences into a cohseive whole.</p>

  <p>Take date night. Imagine a date night recommendation that includes a fashion recommendation (based on the weather and trending fashions), a restaurant recommendation (based on your past dining habits and trending restaurants), and a transportation recommendation (based on location, commute times, and your personal preferences). And, as icing on the cake, your credit card plans to deliver an in restaurant discount for your meal.</p>

  <h2>But, what’s a brand to do?</h2>
  <p>If you are a brand, i.e. a business that tries to connect the emotion of consumption with the logic of their product, this seismic shift represents (and I am not joking … well, maybe a little …) one of the single greatest business opportunities in the history of man. To take full advantage of this trend, brands should actively do the following:</p>

  <ol class="post-list">
    <li>Build a multi-disciplinary team of thinkers and doers (people who think about making and then, do it) who are focused on extracting value from the holy trinity of connectivity, data, and context.</li>
    <li>Create and support a culture that is rooted in experimentation and iteration. Stop thinking about campaign cycles, and start thinking about continuous innovation and improvement.</li>
    <li>Move away from traditional advertising and concentrate on the creation of connected products that improve your understanding of customers.</li>
    <li>And, find ways to define your brand through the digital interactions that you have with consumers. Develop a unique and ownable perspective on the value you deliver. There are plenty of great examples, but I’d start with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkuSBVH0Vm0" rel="nofollow">the work that companies like Nike are doing</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Unlike many, who shiver at the thought of this inevitability, I like the idea. Senseless advertisements, thoughtless campaigns, and wasteful direct mail bother me. Take down the billboard, free up the public space for art, let me connect anywhere at any moment. If you need a way to reach me, I have a smartphone in my pocket. (If I feel like ignoring you, I’ll just leave it in my pocket.)</p>

  <p>Context-driven big data delivered through a connected network might deliver more than you could hope for, and as always, what you do with it in the moment will be up to you.</p>
